#[Project 1: The visualization of changes in currency exchange rates](https://github.com/Justyna0908/JJ-s-portfolio-)

This is an exercise I have recently done in which I use NBP's API (the central bank of the Republic of Poland's API)to retrieve currency exchange rate data over the last 20 years for a chosen currency against PLN and present it using a plot. 
The way it works is you choose the action you want to take (1-Choose currency or 2-Exit the program). Having chosen the "Choose currency" option you input the code of the currency you want to see on the plot (e.g.EUR). In the end the program presents the currency exchange rates at the beginning of each year (2005-2025) and visualizes them using a plot. From there, you can once again choose one of the two possible actions (select currency or exit the program).
* Data was taken from NBP Web API
* It uses API, matplotlib, json
